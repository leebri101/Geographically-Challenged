## **Project Planning**
### **Target Audiences:**
<!-- * For users --> 

### **Site Objectives:**
* 

### **User Stories:**
* 

### **How will this be achieved:**
<!-- (to change all info) * The home page will allow the user a brief introduction as to what Yu-Gi-Oh is and a navigation point to different parts of the site.

* The site will provbide multiple links and resources such as:
    * The official website on Yu-Gi-Oh where it will show the latest updates and new decks that will be released by Konami.
    * Links to an extenseive database/deckbuilder where the user can create tehir ideal deck.
    * Embedded Youtube Videos showcasing tips and tricks.

* The site will provide different options on where to be involved with the Yu-Gi-Oh Community.
    * Through official Konami made apps where users can pit against each other virtually or in person.
    * Fan-made websites where the user can play virtual decks.

* The site will provide users a link on where to watch the series (providing they have an account linked via Crunchyroll or any affiliated anime streaming sites). -->

### **WireFrames:**
<!--
* To prevent any digression to the from the scope objectives, I have made wireframes for the project. Both the mobile and desktop version will have links to their respected versions of all six pages of the Yugioh guide:

    * Mobile Wireframes:
    * [Home-page](doc/wireframes/home-page.png)
    * [Essentials](doc/wireframes/essentials.png)
    * [Card Info](doc/wireframes/card-info.png)
    * [Decks](doc/wireframes/decks.png)
    * [How To play](doc/wireframes/how-to-play.png)
    * [Banlist](doc/wireframes/banlist.png)

    * Desktop Wireframes:
    * [Home-page](doc/wireframes/about-page.png)
    * [Essentials](doc/wireframes/essentials-page.png)
    * [Card Info](doc/wireframes/card-info-page.png)
    * [Decks](doc/wireframes/decks-page.png)
    * [How To play](doc/wireframes/how-to-play-page.png)
    * [Banlist](doc/wireframes/banlist-page.png)

There was small changes from the planned wireframes to enhancve the UX (User Experience). Changess include:-

* Links on the homepage which direct teh user to differnt extrnal site e.g Youtube or the offcial Yu-Gi-OH site.
* Headings and placement of content to allow for a smoother flow and consistency across all pages.

### **Color Scheme:**
 * When creating the intial overall design of the site I have decided to use this colour scheme to go with the overall Yugioh to make it look more mysterious and within the color scheme of the cards from monster effects, to spells, traps and the newer cards which Konami have introduced, for example; XYZ , Synchro and Link monsters.

## **Current Features on all pages**
###  **Headers**
* All Headers have always been stuck to the top left of the pages or the center for mobile. The orginal plan was to use the headers as a way to naviagte back to the home-page but due to time constraints of the project being due very soon, it will be added at a later date a new feature.

* The headers contain all of the features

 The header itself contains the following features: 

### *Title:*
![Title](doc/screenshots/title.webp)

* The title is there to indicate the purpose of each page.

#### *Logos:*
* The logos illustrate the site's theme and offer something to appease the user's eye by filling the blank space without distracting from the title.

    * The logo on mobile version is to make sure that the title is enalarged on a smaller screen for a better user experience. 

        ![Mobile Logo](doc/screenshots/mobile-logo.webp)

    * Whereas the logo on the desktop version is to fill as much white space as possible on a higher screen resolution for a much cleaner appearence. 

        ![Desktop Logo](doc/screenshots/logo.webp)

#### *Navigation tabs:*
* all of the navigation tabs appear on all 6 pages of the site.
* Each of the pages links to the about page, essentials, card information, decks, how to play, and the current banlist allowing for easy navigation between the tabs.
* In the image below it shows that whenever a user is on the current page it is highlighted underneath a small purple line.
* Hovering over the menu will turn the highlighted word in a different color.

  ![Navigation tabs](doc/screenshots/tabs.webp)


### **Hero Images**
* I have only added the hero image on the main home-page to act as the main attraction at which people would see once they open the link.
* The image has a zoom animation to attract the user to make it more presentable. 
* Each of the iamges used in this project is within them of Yugioh or explaining the functionality of the cards.

### **Home-Page**:
#### *Hero-Image:*
The picture used in as the hero image is none other than Linkuriboh, this cute round monster has appeared on the anime series of Yu-Gi-Oh Vrains which is the first to introduce Link summoning which is later introduced in the TCG game.
![Home-page hero-image](doc/screenshots/linkuriboh.jpg)

### **Essentials-Page**:
#### *Hero-Image:*
the picture used for the main banner for all of the pages is from a fan based site which produce incredible wallpapers for all Yu-Gi-Oh fans.
![Essentials-page hero-image](doc/screenshots/yugioh-wallpaper.jpg)

## **Anchor Tags Within the Pages Contents**
* All anchor tags that have been used in the page's contents do not have a under-lined hyperlink.
* Instead there is a color change upon hovering the links and also a color change upon visting the pages.
* The Hoevr over effect on all th ehyper links show a red color contrast from the original gold text to indicate the user about to select a different link.
* Have a hover-over effect that turns the Hyperlink a darker color from the gold gradient used throughout the page.
* At which i have created a seperate code in style.css to show that once the user has been to the site it will change from gold to red.

## **Footer**
* The footer has direct links to all of the offcial social media accounts of the Yu-Gi-oh franchise with an open invitation to follow all channels. 

* All the icons were imported from  the font awesome site using Javascript at the bottom of the page.

* In some of the footers on the rest of the pages I have included that a disclaimer that the site that is being built is merely a fan-based site at which it acts as a guide for returning or new players interested in the franchise and that all of the stated material goes to the rightful owners of the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise of STUDIO DICE/SHUEISHA, TV TOKYO, and KONAMI.

![Footer-Page](doc/screenshots/footer.webp)

## **Typesetting**
 Throughput the project all of the fonts that were used were primarily 
  * Oswald - for an eyecatching look.
  * Space mono- for the retro gaming effect it has.#

  * All Fonts that have been sued have been sourced from Google Fonts (as quoted in the credits)

### **Banlist-Page Contents:**
* This just shows a very static list of all of the upadated various cards that have been banned in any sort of offcial competition setting by Konami.
* My Original idea was to link each of the cards to the data-base of the offcial Yu-Gi-Oh site but it will be mentioned in the [Potential-Features](#potential-features). 
![Banlist-Page](doc/screenshots/current-banlist.webp)


## **Potential-Features**
* Due to the project deadlines being very tight urgent the project had to be scaled down to a more simpler version of the geography quiz but these are the features that i would like to potentially add or implement in the near future:
    * An initeractive version with sounds and unique animations.
    * Potentially adding a leaderboard system / table to challenge and rival other users.
    * A narration voice over for all the questions and answers for users with disablity issues.

 ## **Credits**
### **Honorable mentions**
The second project was a very interesting but difficult challenge, which tested my understanding of HTML & CSS but to incorperate JavaScript too. However the more stuff that was being introduced to the project the more simpler and effective the project became due to time restraints of the course, but nonetheless it is a good way to show what i can do, but i must credit the following people:
 * [Can Sucullu](https://github.com/cansucullu) - My Code Institute mentor who is incredible at giving me insite and suggestions on further improving my project and is a huge help to continuously support me for any sort of technical issues within the project.
* The Slack community of Code Institute for helping me the JavaScript module as it is somewhat challenging due to the deadline and questions on the module. 
* My older brother for always being available for being a personal guinea pig for my projects (and with many more to come) and giving me constant constructive feedback all the time.
* Huge thanks to my girlfriend for the constant support and nagging me to stay focussed whenever i get distacted and also giving me useful advice and insight.


### **General reference:**
* The project theme was inspired by the Code Institute's coding project called Love Maths. I have tried to change as much as possible but there may be some similarties within the codes.
* I have used W3Schools for a basic understanding and learning process for knowing JavaScript a bit better, and for general basic coding references and as general encyclopedia for any code related issues or ideas.
